- Report for audits (can be filtered by subsystem and log type (event or error)). Even is when someone registers in the site,
make a purchase, change roles e.t.c. Error is when user makes a mistake - type wrong passord, types wrong url, tries to make something stupid.
All reports can be downloaded in csv and excel (download is on baches. I am using async generator in js and generator in python).
