- Every report is described with json object. Front end is made from this json and back end is following the same pattern.
In the back end we just need to write the query. So for new report we need json object sql.
- Report for audits (can be filtered by subsystem and log type (event or error)). Even is when someone registers in the site,
make a purchase, change roles e.t.c. Error is when user makes a mistake - type wrong passord, types wrong url, tries to make something stupid.
All reports can be downloaded in csv and excel (download is on baches. I am using async generator in js and generator in python).
